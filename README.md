## Project Description

**Assessly** will let hiring teams set up custom developer assessments and let candidates complete them, capturing their screen activity and AI tool usage as they tackle a given task. A built-in voice assistant reads the prompt aloud and answers questions on demand, ensuring candidates stay focused while maintaining a clear record of their thought process. Recruiters can tailor each assessmentâ€™s criteria to match their needs, and companies subscribe to monthly tiered plans based on the number of assessments and candidates they require. After each session, hiring managers simply log into a dashboard to see a candidateâ€™s summary of performance, making it easy to identify the most productive, AI-savvy developers.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Additional Requirement

**Real-time interaction:** The candidateâ€™s screen is shared with the agent as they work. At the same time, the voice agent listens and responds immediately whenever the candidate asks a question, creating a seamless, live conversation during the assessment.
